# Computational-Statistics
This project was submitted as a final exam for the course Computational Statistics, as part of the MS.c. in Economics program at Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universit√§t Bonn. It presents the contribution made to the study conducted by _Saha, S., & Gounder, R. (2013). Corruption and economic development nexus: Variations across income levels in a non-linear framework._

The main objective of this work is to examine whether statistical methods: Regression trees, Bagging and Random forest could serve as an alternative to a simple linear model in the context of investigating a non-linear association between corruption and economic development.
